        <h3>Welcome to my site.</h3>
        <p>I am Jr. Web Developer currently looking for a full time employment opportunity.  I orriginaly got into programing because I had an interest in software.  I was curious about how things worked internally, and wanted to create things of my own.</p>
        <p>I spent a large number of my teen years writing very basic scripts with a friend, and making (very poorly made) games in C++.  I got introduced to Javascript through a good friend, and mentor of mine.  I helped develop the front end by writing script that would compare the stats pulled from employees, and pass them through an algorithm to determine performance, and scores.  After delving a bit into the complexity of Javascript I decided I wanted to learn more, and enrolled in Computer science at a local college.  I believe that continuing education is fundemental to the field, and I'm currently learning Angular, and working to strengethen my skills with Node.JS.</p>
        <p>You can find more on my <a href="https://github.com/F1tter/">Github</a></p>
